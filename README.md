# PowerQueryFunctions
## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Power Query functions.

## History
This repository was inspired by [Injae Park's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXFxiEVAmfI) and [repository](https://github.com/PowerBIPark/PowerBI_MQueryTest) on how to version control Power BI; specially useful were the references he included:

## Usage
1. Open the file [M.pq](M.pq) and copy the code.
2. Open an advance editor in Power Query and paste the code, rename the query to "M".
3. Use the functions as records on M. For example, PictureBinary.pq can be invoked like: 

`M[PictureBinary.pq](table, number, number)`
